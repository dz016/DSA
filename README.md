# DSA Repository

Welcome to the **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** repository! This repository contains my personal implementations and solutions related to data structures and algorithmic problems. The project is divided into two main sections:

## 1. Implementation

In this section, you will find the custom implementations of various data structures. Each data structure is implemented in Python, encapsulated in its own class.

### Included Data Structures:
- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Heaps**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Tries**
- And more...

Each data structure includes:
- **Class Implementation**: A Python class that defines the structure and operations (like insert, delete, search, etc.).


## 2. LeetCode Solutions

This section contains my solutions to various algorithmic problems found on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Each solution is written in Python and follows a structured format for clarity.

### Problem Categories:
- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Backtracking**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- And more...

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Section**:
    - For data structure implementations, go to the `implementation` folder.
    - For LeetCode problem solutions, go to the `leetcode_solutions` folder.

3. **Run the Code**: All code files are written in Python. You can run them using Python 3.x.
    ```bash
    python filename.py
    ```



Happy Coding! ðŸš€
